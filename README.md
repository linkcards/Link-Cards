# Link Cards

👋 Hi! Welcome to Link Cards’ public issue tracker and feature requests repo.


## Submitting an issue or feature request

Have an issue you’d like to report or a feature request you’d like to make? Well,
you’re in the right place. New issues and feature requests are always welcomed
and appreciated. But, before submitting a new please be sure to search the
[existing issues](https://github.com/linkcards/Link-Cards/issues) to
see if your issue or request has already been submitted.

If you find an issue or request that is the same, or similar to what you were
going to submit, please __upvote__ it with a __:+1: reaction__ to help bubble up
the most pressing or promising issues and requests.

And, if you don’t find an existing issue, please create a __new issue__ by using
the provided template.


## Additional support or questions

If you have an issue that you feel is only relevant to your account, or a feature
request that is just too magical to be shared publicly, you can always reach out
to me directly.

Or

Send me an email __hello@linkcards.io__

I look forward to hearing from you!
